          <h2>Working Out</h2>
            <p> One of my favorite hobbies is to work out.
              Although I'm not aiming for a body like the Greek gods, being fit is an important aspect of respecting my body.
              I am currently a member at LA Fitness</p>
          <h2>Kayaking</h2>
            <p> Kayaking is one of my newfound hobbies that I found to enjoy this past summer.
              Will County is full of streams fit for kayaking, canoeing, and fishing.</p>
          <h2>Enjoying Music</h2>
            <p>Who doesn't enjoy a good song?
              I prefer music such as rap, EDM, or Punjabi pop.
              In my downtime, jazz, piano, and lofi hiphop are much more preferable.</p>
